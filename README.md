# Portfolio Monte Carlo Simulation

This repository compares Monte Carlo Simulations between different weight allocations among portfolios and use this analysis to create an ideal, custom porfolio.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to:

  1. Read in and clean portfolio data
  2. Determine the gains/losses over a time period
  3. Build and evaluate a custome portfolio

## Methods

This project focuses on reading, organizing and manipulating dataframes retrieved using an Alpaca API. Pandas is used to conduct a quantitative analysis is conducted to calculate the risk metrics and performance of the given crypto savings account.

Then, the savings porfolio is analyzed for its performance under different weight allocations to determine the optimum weight distribution. Monte Carlo Simulations are run under different weight allocations and initial investments to project the potential future value of the portfolio in different scenarios.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze a given savings portfolio and determine the optimum structure of the given investment portfolio to maximize potential future earnings. Weight distribution and initial investment size are configured to maximize future returns.
